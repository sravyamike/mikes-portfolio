<hr>
<p style="font-size:20px">“By discovering nature, you discover yourself.” –  Maxime Lagacé, A beautifully penned sentence. Nature is the entire physical world around us in a broad sense. It includes atmosphere, weather, ecosystem, flora, fauna, and landscapes. The beautiful environment around us who we call nature is the mother of all humans. It nurtures and nourishes us. It provides us with all the necessities to survive. Right from the food we eat, the air we breathe, the clothes we wear, and the houses we live in are the gift of nature. God has only gifted earth with nature, and we should be thankful for that.

<p class="text-center" style="margin-top:50px">Friendship is a relationship of mutual affection between people.[1] It is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an association, and has been studied in academic fields such as communication, sociology, social psychology, anthropology, and philosophy. Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics, and attachment styles.

Although there are many forms of friendship, some of which may vary from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many types of such bonds. Such characteristics include affection, kindness, love, virtue, sympathy, empathy, honesty, altruism, loyalty, generosity, forgiveness, mutual understanding and compassion, enjoyment of each other's company, trust, and the ability to be oneself, express one's feelings to others, and make mistakes without fear of judgment from the friend. Friendship is an essential aspect of relationship building skills.</p>
